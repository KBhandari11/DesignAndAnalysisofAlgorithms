# DesignAndAnalysisofAlgorithms
All the assignments from the class


HW1--Recursion
Implement MergeSort in Java, using the C++ program provided in the lecture notes as a starting point. Create a class Array and find a way to have this class provide some of the functionality needed to implement MergeSort.
Implement FindMaxSubarray in Java, also using your custom Array class.
For both assignments, use a directory structure as discussed in the Java class: create a package recursion, and use 4 directories: sources (source code), classes (compiled classes), packages (a lib subdirectory for the *.jar file of your application), and resources (text files to read the arrays from). Compile using ant. A sample build.xml file is provided.

Assignment
HW 2--Recursion
Implement RecursiveMatrixMultiplication according to the algorithm described in Lecture 2.

Assignment
HW 3--Sorting
1. Implement Shellsort in Python.
2. Design a priority queue Java project to alphabetize pet names, as described in the HW at the end of Lecture 3.

Assignment
HW 4--Sorting
Implement Bucketsort in Python, using Quicksort for each bucket, see instructions at the end of Lecture 4.

Assignment
HW 5--Hash Tables
Implement a hash table using the multiplication method. Implement linked lists to store hash data for which the keys hashes onto the same values. The assignment is described at the end of Lecture 5.

Assignment
HW 6--Least Common Subsequence
Write a memoized recursive LCS in Python, using as a starter program the C++ implementation in Lecture 6. Your version, however, should also print the least common subsequence.

Assignment
HW 7--B-Trees
Present, with pseudo-code, diagram, and explanations, the algorithm for deleting a key from a B-tree. Refer to pp.499-502 from the textbook (Cormen-Leiserson-Rivest).

Assignment
Final Project--LUP Decomposition
Write a program, in the language of your choice, that checks whether an input matrix is invertible and inverts it using LUP decomposition as described in Lecture 10.
